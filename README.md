# Wimbledon Court Notifier

The courts at Wimbledon must be covered during rain although this year there have been communication issues with telling all courts the current instructions for covering courts. Currently, court attendees must keep watch of a display that shows the court code (which has a corresponding instruction).

This app uses [Pushsafer](https://www.pushsafer.com/), installed on court attendees phones, to send push notifications to their devices. A manager send the notification from this app.
